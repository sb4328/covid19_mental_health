## Read data

```{r}
mhealth_df =
  read_csv("data/Indicators_of_Anxiety_or_Depression_Based_on_Reported_Frequency_of_Symptoms_During_Last_7_Days.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(mhealth_ind = indicator,
         mhealth_value = value,
         mhealth_lowci = low_ci,
         mhealth_highci =  high_ci,
         mhealth_ci = confidence_interval,
         mhealth_qrange = quartile_range)

access_df =
  read_csv("data/Indicators_of_Reduced_Access_to_Care_Due_to_the_Coronavirus_Pandemic_During_Last_4_Weeks.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(access_ind = indicator,
         access_value = value,
         access_lowci = low_ci,
         access_highci =  high_ci,
         access_ci = confidence_interval,
         access_qrange = quartile_range,
         time_period = week,
         time_period_label = week_label)

combined_df = 
  left_join(mhealth_df, access_df, by = c("phase", "group", "state", "subgroup", "time_period", "time_period_label")) %>% 
  relocate("phase", "group", "state", "subgroup", "time_period", "time_period_label")
```

## Correlation analyses

```{r}
correlation_df =
  combined_df %>% 
  filter(mhealth_ind == "Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder or Depressive Disorder" & access_ind == "Delayed or Did Not Get Care, Last 4 Weeks")

cor.test(correlation_df$mhealth_value, correlation_df$access_value, alternative = ("two.sided"), method = c("pearson"))
```
